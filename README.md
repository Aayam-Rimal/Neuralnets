# Neural Networks Learning

A hands-on repository for learning neural network fundamentals through implementation.

## About

This is a collection of neural network implementations and experiments built from scratch and using popular frameworks. The goal is to deeply understand how neural networks work by implementing core concepts manually before leveraging high-level libraries.

## Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `numpy_scratch/` | Pure NumPy implementations of neural networks — no deep learning frameworks. Covers forward/backward propagation, activation functions, and gradient descent from first principles. |
| `pytorch/` | PyTorch implementations exploring the framework's abstractions for building and training neural networks. |

## Getting Started

```sh
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
